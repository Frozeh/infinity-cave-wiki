     <h2>Structures</h2>
     <p>Mushroom Gorge contains 5 structures, 1 which is biome-specific, that being the Mushroom House, known for its elevator at the middle and its mystery revolving magic mushrooms. The trial spawners may spawn here as well.</p>
    <h2>Magic Mushroom</h2>
     <p>Growing Nether Wart in Mushroom Gorge will not only drop Nether Wart, but Magic Mushrooms, these mushrooms when eaten will grant the player a random potion effect, which scales with the player's progression level. It may also shrink or grow the player.</p>
    <h2>Size Mechanic</h2>
    <p>After being shrunk or enlarged by a Magic Mushroom or by a Legendary element, the player will be checked every second, where there is a 0.5% chance to return to original size. It is possible to get rid of this mysterious effect by drinking milk or dying. If the player wants to keep the size modification for longer, it is possible to use a Magic Mushroom that grants the user Bad Luck, as long as the player has Bad Luck, the size effect will not cease.</p>
